# _Simple-Nano-Processor_

## Project Description
__Programming Language :__ VHDL
<br>__Developer Tool :__ Xilinx Vivado

It was a <a herf="https://github.com/sthanikan2000/Simple-Nano-Processor/blob/main/Lab_Description.pdf">final lab</a> and a group project for the ***CS-1050 Computer Organization and Digital Design*** module offered by the _Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Moratuwa_ in the _2<sup>nd</sup> semester of Batch 20._

Two different designs were created during the project.
<br>[_Optimized Design_](https://github.com/sthanikan2000/Simple-Nano-Processor/blob/main/Optimized_Design_Source_Files.rar) : Design that only satisfies the functional requirements of the lab.
<br>[_Extra Features Added Design_](https://github.com/sthanikan2000/Simple-Nano-Processor/blob/main/Extra_Features_Added_Design_Source_Files.rar) : Extended design capable of Run two different sets of instructions hardcoded in two different Program ROMs. Also, It can control all four segments of seven segment display and can show some extra flags of the Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU).

Whole details about the project such as,
<br>_1. Lab Task_
<br>_2. Optimized Design Primitives and Slice Logic_
<br>_3. Additional features and optimizations to design_
<br>_4. Specific Instructions for operating the machine_
<br>_5. Conclusion_
<br>_6. Individual contributions of each group member_
<br>_7. Component source codes, Test bench codes, Timing Diagram & Schematics_
<br>       are included in [ ***Nano_Processor_Design_Competition_Final_Report.pdf***](https://github.com/sthanikan2000/Simple-Nano-Processor/blob/main/Nano_Processor_Design_Competition_Final_Report.pdf)
<br>
<br> Bit stream files which are included in [_BitStream_Files.rar_](https://github.com/sthanikan2000/Simple-Nano-Processor/blob/main/BitStream_Files.rar)
can be tested on a BASYS3 FPGA Board with the help of ***Section-04 : Specific Instructions for operating the machine*** of [_Nano_Processor_Design_Competition_Final_Report.pdf_](https://github.com/sthanikan2000/Simple-Nano-Processor/blob/main/Nano_Processor_Design_Competition_Final_Report.pdf)
