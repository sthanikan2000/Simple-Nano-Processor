2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Out_controll_7seg_0/Anode_out_reg[1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Out_controll_7seg_0/Anode_out_reg[0]/CLR, Out_controll_7seg_0/Anode_out_reg[1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
